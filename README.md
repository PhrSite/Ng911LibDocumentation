To build the documentation, open a command prompt and change to the the Ng911LibDocumentation directory and then type docfx.

The documentation web site on github.io is setup to deploy the static web site when this project is pushed to GitHub. The documentation pages are located at [https://phrsite.github.io/Ng911LibDocumentation](https://phrsite.github.io/Ng911LibDocumentation).
