# The Ng911LibDocumentation Project
This is the GitHub Pages documentation project for the Ng911Lib class library.

This is a [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx) project so DocFX must be installed on you system before you can build the documentation GitHub Pages static web site for the Ng911Lib project.

To build the documentation, open a command prompt and change to the the Ng911LibDocumentation directory and then type docfx.

** Note: The docfx.json configuration file uses a relative path to the Ng911Lib project so the Ng911LibDocumentation project must be located at the same directory level as the Ng911Lib project. For example, if the Ng911Lib project is located under c:\MyProjects, then the Ng911LibDocumentation project must also be located under \MyProjects.**

The documentation web site on github.io is setup to deploy the static web site when this project is pushed to GitHub. The documentation pages are located at [https://phrsite.github.io/Ng911LibDocumentation](https://phrsite.github.io/Ng911LibDocumentation).
